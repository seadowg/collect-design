# Repeat groups

This is motivated by a narrative emerging on the forum around changes people want make to repeat groups.

## Questions

* What kinds of questions are being answered (data is being collected) using repeat groups?
* What are the pain points form designers are experiencing with repeat groups?
* Are there tweaks to repeat groups we can make to make repeat groups easier?
* Are there any new features we could build or reworks we could carry out that would provide better solutions than the current repeat groups feature?

## Plan

- [x] Use forum posts to collect initial research (using "insight/opportunity/pain point" format)
- [ ] Write interview script with [questions](#questions) and initial research as input
- [ ] Perform interviews with 3-5 form designers using script
- [ ] Synthesize results of interviews and attempt to answer questions

## Interview Script

*Pending.*
