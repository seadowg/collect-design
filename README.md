# ODK Collect Design ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“‹

This repo collects design documents for [ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect).

## Research

Research will be planned and results posted within this repo. Each research round should be represented by a single document in the `research` directory.

Previous research rounds:

* [Repeats](research/repeats)

## Prototypes

Prototypes for potential/experimental features in Collect will be added here. This can be in the form of wireframes, sketch files, working apps etc.

Previous feature prototypes:

* [Identify User](prototypes/identify-user)
* [Track Changes Reason](prototypes/track-changes-reason)
* [Repeat Tweaks](prototypes/repeat-tweaks)
* [Revised Main Menu](prototypes/revised-main-menu)
* [Minimal Automcomplete Select](prototypes/minimal-autocomplete-select)

## Theme

Collect uses a [Material Theme](https://material.io/design/material-theming/) as the basis for its design and style guide. This repo contains a Figma project (`theme/baseline.fig`) representing the theme and that can be used to build and contribute mockups for Collect.

### Style guide
