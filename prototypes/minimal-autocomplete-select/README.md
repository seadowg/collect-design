# Minimal Automcomplete Select

This prototype shows how the `minimal` and `autocomplete` appearances could be combined. Form designers have asked for this in cases where they need to present a select with many different options (that really need to be searchable) as part of a field-list.

The thinking around the design was to mimic a search autocomplete flow in Android.

A Figma prototype for the flow can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/Dxe1UF9reRdLYy8o5jishW/Minimal-automcomplete-select?node-id=24%3A1774&viewport=826%2C271%2C0.500446617603302&scaling=min-zoom).
