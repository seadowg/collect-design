# Audio recording

This is motivated by many requests to allow background audio recording during form entry.

## Goals

The questions we want to answer during this research round are:

* Are form designers using the audio question to record already?
* What are form designers recording as part of a form and why?
* What constraints lead to form designers using different audio formats/encodings?
* Do data analysts want to be able to check audio recorded during an interview?
* Do form designers want to be able to record audio along side another answer to a question (and answer at the same time)?

## Plan

- [x] Add analytics to Collect around current audio question use
- [x] Write interview script with goals in mind
- [x] Carry out conversations (3-5) with potential users and stack holders using script
- [x] Break each interview into "insight/opportunity/pain point" format

## Interview script

1. I'm [your-name] and I'm doing some research into people using ODK tools for the ODK community.
1. This is a fairly informal conversation. The goal is just to get a better sense of how you use ODK tools. There arenâ€™t any right or wrong answers here - your experience is the most interesting thing. We'll share the anonymized insights from this interview with the community to help us to continue to develop ODK.
1. Are you happy to be recorded?
1. Would you be able to tell me about your day to day job?
1. What kind of data do you usually collect using ODK?
1. What kind of devices do you use for data collection?
1. Have you ever collected audio as part of a form with ODK? How did you set that up? Go into detail.
1. Did using the audio question get you the data you needed? Was there anything that got in your way or was missing? Did the enumerators run into any problems while recording?
1. Have you ever recorded audio during a data collection study outside of using ODK? If so, what were you collecting and how did you set it up?
1. Have you used the audit log feature of ODK Collect before? If so, what for?
1. Did using the audit log accomplish the goals you had when you decided to use it?
1. Do you ever need transcripts of conversations that happen during form entry? If so, how do you accomplish that?
