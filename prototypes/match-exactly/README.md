# Match Exactly

![](enumerator-flow.jpg)

Originally based on [this forum post](https://forum.getodk.org/t/have-collect-exactly-match-the-forms-on-central/23101) which describes the problems that projects are running into.

This feature introduces a setting to Collect that once enabled changes the behaviour so that Collect will match the forms on the server rather than letting form management occur on device. A mockup of this flow is [here](enumerator-flow.jpg). Syning with the server will happen automatically in the background and also can be performed by the enumerator via the refresh button in "Fill Blank Forms".

The setting will live in Collect's existing "Form Management" screen. A Figma prototype of it can be found [here](settings.fig).
