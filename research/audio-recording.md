# Audio recording

This is motivated by many requests to allow background audio recording during form entry.

## Goals

The questions we want to answer during this research round are:

* Why do form designers need to record audio during interviews?
* Are there constraints around the output in terms of size, format etc? Are these universal enough not to be configurable?
* Could the audio question type be used in place of background audio recording in some cases?

## Plan

- [ ] Write interview script with goals in mind
- [ ] Carry out conversations (3-5) with potential users and stack holders using script
- [ ] Break each interview into "insight/opportunity/pain point" format
- [ ] Synthesize (pull out common items) results of interviews and attempt to answer questions
