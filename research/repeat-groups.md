# Repeat groups

This is motivated by a narrative emerging on the forum around changes people want make to repeat groups.

## Questions

* What kinds of questions are being answered (data is being collected) using repeat groups?
* What are the pain points form designers are experiencing with repeat groups?
* Are there tweaks to repeat groups we can make to make repeat groups easier?
* Are there any new features we could build or reworks we could carry out that would provide better solutions than the current repeat groups feature?

## Plan

- [x] Use forum posts to collect initial research (using "insight/opportunity/pain point" format)
- [x] Write interview script with [questions](#questions) and initial research as input
- [ ] Perform interviews with 3-5 form designers using script
- [ ] Break each interview into "insight/opportunity/pain point" format
- [ ] Synthesize (pull out common items) results of interviews and attempt to answer questions

## Interview script

1. This is a fairly informal conversation. The goal is just to get a better sense of how you use ODK tools. There arenâ€™t any right or wrong answers here - your experience is the most interesting thing.
2. Are you happy to be recorded?
3. ...and are you happy with us sharing the insights of this interview publically?
4. Would you be able to tell me about your day to day job?
5. Could you tell me about the last time you used ODK as part of your job? Go into detail about your involvement as much as possible.
6. Do you ever use repeat groups as part of your forms? If so, tell me about the last time you did?
7. Did repeat groups let you collect the data you needed?
8. Was this form successful?
9. Had you used repeat groups on other forms before this one? How different were they?
