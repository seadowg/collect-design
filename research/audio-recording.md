# Audio recording

This is motivated by many requests to allow background audio recording during form entry.

## Goals

The questions we want to answer during this research round are:

* Why do form designers need to record audio during interviews?
* Are there constraints around the output in terms of size, format etc? Are these universal enough not to be configurable?
* Could the audio question type be used in place of background audio recording in some cases?

## Plan

- [ ] Write interview script with goals in mind
- [ ] Carry out conversations (3-5) with potential users and stack holders using script
- [ ] Break each interview into "insight/opportunity/pain point" format
- [ ] Synthesize (pull out common items) results of interviews and attempt to answer questions

## Interview script

1. I'm [your-name] and I'm doing some research into people using ODK tools for the ODK community.
1. This is a fairly informal conversation. The goal is just to get a better sense of how you use ODK tools. There arenâ€™t any right or wrong answers here - your experience is the most interesting thing. We'll share the anonymized insights from this interview with the community to help us to continue to develop ODK.
1. Are you happy to be recorded?
1. Would you be able to tell me about your day to day job?
1. Have you ever used the audio question as part of a form? If so, what app did you use to record audio and how did you configure it?
1. Did using the audio question get you the data you needed? If not, why not?
1. Have you ever recorded audio during a data collection study or project before using and app or hardware external to ODK? If so, why?
1. Have you used the audit log feature of ODK Collect before? If so, what for?
1. Did using the audit log accomplish the goals you had when you decided to use it?
1. Do you ever need transcripts of conversations that happen during form entry? If so, how do you accomplish that?
1. What kind of devices do you use for data collection?
